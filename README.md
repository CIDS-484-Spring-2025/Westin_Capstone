## Project Overview
I am creating an E-commerce website similar to that of Amazon, Newegg, micro center etc. I want to create a website for the main reason of learning how both the front-end and back-end of a website works. The focus of this is to utilize my current skills and build new ones with technology I have not used before.

## Goals
- Create a user-freindly user interface
- Create user accounts
- Have a cart to keep items
- Have a complete backend
- Have search funcionality

## Technology 
Front End:
- Html
- CSS
- Javascript

Back End:
- mySQL 
- Node.js

## Timeline
- Milestone 1: Have the basic interface and database setup 
- Milestone 2: Work on designing the interface and smoothing the process
- Milestone 3 & Final: Work on the details and performance of the website

## Current Progress
- Created the main database with three tables being Users, Cart, and Items
- Created an html file with a list of some items I made up along with a form for creating a User
- Created a javascript file called server.js that handles input and output information and delivers that to and from the database
